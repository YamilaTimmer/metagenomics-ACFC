    abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing is revolutionizing the detection and characterization of microbial species, and a wide variety of software tools are available to perform taxonomic classification of this data. The fast pace of development of these tools, alongside the complexity of metagenomic data, make it important that researchers are able to benchmark their performance. Here, we review current approaches for metagenomic analysis and evaluate the performance of 20 metagenomic classifiers using simulated and experimental datasets. We describe the key metrics used to assess performance, offer a framework for the comparison of additional classifiers, and discuss the future of metagenomic data analysis.},

    abstract = {Antibiotic or antimicrobial resistance (AR) facilitated by the vertical and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), is a serious global health challenge. While traditionally associated with pathogens in clinical environments, it is becoming increasingly clear that non-clinical environments may also be reservoirs of ARGs. The recent improvements in rapid and affordable next generation sequencing technologies along with sophisticated bioinformatics platforms has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic microbiology and microbial surveillance. Through the study and characterization of ARGs in bacterial genomes and complex metagenomes, we are now able to reveal the genetic scope of AR in single bacteria and complex communities, and obtain important insights into AR dynamics at species, population and community levels, providing novel epidemiological and ecological perspectives. A suite of bioinformatics pipelines and ARG databases are currently available for genomic and metagenomic data analyses. However, different platforms may significantly vary and therefore, it is crucial to choose the tools that are most suitable for the specific analysis being conducted. This review provides a detailed account of available bioinformatics platforms for identification and characterization of ARGs and associated genetic elements within single bacterial isolates and complex environmental samples. It focuses primarily on currently available ARG databases, employing a comprehensive benchmarking pipeline to identify ARGs in four bacterial genomes (Aeromonas salmonicida, Bacillus cereus, Burkholderia sp. and Escherichia coli) and three shotgun metagenomes (human gut, poultry litter and soil) providing insight into which databases should be used for different analytical scenarios.},
