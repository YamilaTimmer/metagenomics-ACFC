# Introductie

The sequencing data obtained from the MinION platform underwent a
quality assessment process. Initially, the sequences were evaluated for
quality using `Fastplong` (OpenGene, 2023) (Chen et al., 2018). After
this, `Fastplong` also trimmed the data according to the generated
reports. Following this, a secondary quality assessment was conducted
using `Fastplong` to ensure improved data quality. The refined dataset
was then subjected to taxonomic classification through `Kraken2` (Wood
et al., 2019), a computational tool for microbial classification. The
results generated by `Kraken2` were then visualised using `KronaTools`
(Ondov et al., 2011) and `Pavian` (Breitwieser & Salzberg, 2020),
facilitating an interactive and intuitive representation of the
taxonomic distribution. Other tools like `HUMAnN 3.0` (Beghini et al.,
2021) were used for profiling the abundance of microbial metabolic
pathways and other molecular functions from metagenomics data (Beghini
et al., 2021). Furthermore, the outcomes obtained from the `Kraken2`
analysis were employed to identify the microorganisms present in the
lagoon water, this allowed comparing the different lagoon stages and
their microbiomes. To get more insight into the data, using two Python
Kraken2 plugins that made a Shannon index for alpha diversity, this
index showed the species diversity in each sample. This index also
showed the distribution of the species in the samples. Also, using a
different Python script, a beta diversity analysis was made. With all
this information, an analysis of each stage of the lagoon has been made.

**FastQC Quality control**\
FastQC is used to check the quality of raw data, determining if the data
is ready for use or needs trimming. The trimmer can also be adjusted
based on FastQC results. [@BabrahamBioinformatics]

We use FastQC to ensure the data is suitable for analysis. Poor-quality
data can lead to unreliable and non-reproducible results.

Below is a breakdown of the results from a FastQC check and how to
interpret them.

| Category                         | Result                                                                                                                                      | How to Interpret                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Statistics**             | A table with details such as Filename, File Type, Sequence Length, %GC, Total Sequences, Encoding, and Sequences Flagged as Poor Quality.   | Read and check the table for errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Per Base Sequence Quality**    | A graph (see Figure 1).                                                                                                                     | The graph has three colored zones: 28-40 (green, good quality), 20-28 (yellow/orange, moderate quality), and 0-20 (red, poor quality). The yellow box represents the 25th to 75th percentile, the black lines show the 10th and 90th percentiles, and the blue line represents the average quality score. A drop in quality after base 100 indicates trimming is needed. |
| **Per Tile Sequence Quality**    | A heatmap plot showing read quality per tile and position.                                                                                  | Dark blue tiles indicate good quality, while lighter tiles indicate poorer quality. The Y-axis shows the tile number, and the X-axis shows the position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Per Sequence Quality Score**   | A graph showing the average quality score (x-axis) and the number of sequences with that score (y-axis).                                    | Ideally, most reads should have a high average quality score without significant dips, indicating low quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Per Base Sequence Content**    | A plot showing the percentage of each base (A, T, C, G) at each position in the read.                                                       | Significant variation at the beginning (positions 1-10) may indicate sequencing bias. Stabilization after position 10 suggests higher quality in the rest of the reads.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Per Sequence GC Content**      | A plot with two lines: a blue line (theoretical distribution) and a red line (observed GC content).                                         | Ideally, the two lines should overlap or be close. Multiple peaks or deviations from the theoretical line may indicate contamination or sequencing errors. A red cross indicates abnormal GC content compared to expectations.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Per Base N Content**           | A graph showing the frequency of "N" base calls (unknown nucleotides) at each position.                                                     | A high percentage of "N" at any position indicates uncertainty in base calling. The standard is \<1%. Deviations may indicate sequencing issues, often at the start or end of reads.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Sequence Length Distribution** | A graph showing the distribution of read lengths.                                                                                           | Ideally, there should be a sharp peak at the expected read length (e.g., 150 bp). Multiple peaks or a wide spread may indicate sequencing errors, poor adapter trimming, or DNA degradation.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Sequence Duplication Levels**  | A graph showing the percentage of sequences that occur more than once.                                                                      | A sharp drop in the graph indicates most reads have a duplication level of 1. Large differences between the red (duplicated sequences) and blue (total sequences) lines suggest technical artifacts like PCR duplication. High duplication levels can affect downstream analyses.                                                                                        |
| **Overrepresented Sequences**    | A table listing sequences (≥20 bp) that occur more than 0.1% of the total sequences, along with their count, percentage, and likely source. | If abnormalities are seen in the Per Sequence GC Content graph, this table can help identify the source. Sequences not matching known adapters or vectors can be BLASTed for identification.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Adapter Content**              | A graph showing the presence of adapter sequences at different positions.                                                                   | Adapter fragments can be identified and trimmed. The graph helps identify the positions of adapters for removal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Trimmomatic**

Trimmomatic (version x.x) is a versatile and robust tool for the
processing of sequence data, proficient in managing both paired-end and
single-end datasets. The software encompasses a series of trimming steps
accompanied by an array of customizable parameters aimed at optimizing
data quality. As a command-line application, Trimmomatic is especially
advantageous for addressing complexities associated with the
"collapsing" and "trimming" of paired-end reads, particularly in cases
where sequencing fragments are shorter than the read length, which can
lead to undesirable overlaps with adapter sequences present at the
terminal ends of the reads. Ensuring data integrity during the cleaning
process is a fundamental feature of Trimmomatic. The necessity of data
trimming arises predominantly from the presence of low-quality sequence
data. Enhancing data quality is critical, as the extraction of reliable
conclusions is jeopardized by the prevalence of errors often associated
with poor-quality inputs. Trimmomatic's customizable framework allows
for the efficient removal of adapter sequences, while also enabling
specific adjustments tailored to the dataset in question.

**Taxonomische classificatie met Kraken 2**

Kraken 2 is a taxonomic classification system that uses k-mer matches to
get high accuracy and fast classification speeds. A k-mer is a substring
of length k contained within a biological sequence. Simply said, k-mers
are simply length k subsequences. 1-k k-mers are G, T, A, C. 2-k k-mers
are GT, TA, AG, GA, AG, GC, CT, TG, GT. Using the matching principle,
kraken 2 doesn’t have to read the full sequence and can quickly
determine whether a species matches or not.

Kraken 2 will read each sequence and match them to their complementary
counterpart. Giving us the Taxonomy as far as is known for each
microorganism. Helping understand what the water contains.

The output for kraken 2 is a single line of output with five
tab-delimited fields; from left to right they are: “C”/”U”: a one letter
code indicating that the sequence was either classified or unclassified,
The sequence ID, obtained from the FASTA/FASTQ header. The taxonomy ID
Kraken 2 used to label the sequence; this is zero if the sequence is
unclassified. The length of the sequence is in base pairs. In the case
of paired read data, this will be a string containing the lengths of the
two sequences in bp, separated by a pipe character, e.g. “98\|94”.
Lastly, a space-delimited list indicating the LCA mapping (lowest common
ancestor)

**Visualisations of the classification with Pavian** Pavian is an
interactive browser application that analyzes and visualizes
metagenomics classification results from classifiers such as Kraken,
KrakenUniq, Kraken 2, Centrifuge, and MetaPhlAn. Pavian also provides an
alignment viewer to validate matches to a particular genome. The
seamless implementation with Kraken 2 makes this a good choice for
visualisation. The visualisations that are made with Pavian are a
taxonomic classification chart, a Sankey diagram, and an alignment
viewer.

**Feedback** *Instead of reposting the old materials and methods i will
only be putting down the feedback to prevent long re-reads.* - Use past
tense and fix the dual use - Fix the issue about naming “pathogenic
organisms in the lagoon” this is because we want to know what will flow
in the river. Therefore we want to specifically know what kind of
organisms live in the lagoon output, not the lagoon middle. - Make use
of more commas and interpunctions in general. - Change the main focus
from “dangerous microorganisms” to identifying the microbiome of the
lagoon and a global overview of what lives in the three different
steps + what they do. - Fix the following sentence “Using this, we were
able to see the dangers and problems the microorganisms cause in the
lagoon” this needs to be fixed because there arent problems within the
lagoon the problem is what is exciting the lagoon into the river. -

Second feedback on the materials and methods, This time from my team
members and the teacher.

General feedback: Make an overall approach that quickly summarises your
whole pipeline. Fix the over-quoting and remove the ones that aren’t
necessary. Fix spelling isues and make sure the sentences are normal
with an academic tone Add data collection tab that explains how the data
was collected and in our case how it was sequenced + with what settings.

**9th of march** *This is the final version for now, it still is missin
gour data collection due to not being emailed back about it yet.* \## 2.
Materials and methods \#### 2.1 overall approach The sequencing data
obtained from the MinION platform underwent a quality assessment
process. Initially, the sequences were evaluated for quality using
`Fastplong` (OpenGene, 2023) (Chen et al., 2018). After this,
`Fastplong` also trimmed the data according to the generated reports.
Following this, a secondary quality assessment was conducted using
`Fastplong` to ensure improved data quality. The refined dataset was
then subjected to taxonomic classification through `Kraken2` (Wood et
al., 2019), a computational tool for microbial classification. The
results generated by `Kraken2` were then visualised using `KronaTools`
(Ondov et al., 2011) and `Pavian` (Breitwieser & Salzberg, 2020),
facilitating an interactive and intuitive representation of the
taxonomic distribution. Other tools like `HUMAnN 3.0` (Beghini et al.,
2021) were used for profiling the abundance of microbial metabolic
pathways and other molecular functions from metagenomics data (Beghini
et al., 2021). Furthermore, the outcomes obtained from the `Kraken2`
analysis were employed to identify the microorganisms present in the
lagoon water, this allowed comparing the different lagoon stages and
their microbiomes. To get more insight into the data using `QIIME2`
(Bolyen et al., 2019b), a tool that made a Shannon index for alpha
diversity, this index showed the species diversity in each sample. This
index also showed the distribution of the species in the samples. With
all this information, an analysis for each stage of the lagoon has been
made.

#### 2.2 Data collection

Kit voor DNA collection, sequencing kit heeft pcr.

### 2.3 The metagenomics pipeline

#### 2.3.1 **Data Preprocessing and Quality Control**

Raw sequencing data has been received in the FASTQ format, this data was
preprocessed using `fastplong` . A specialized version of the fastp tool
optimised for Nanopore long-read data, adapter and low quality reads
(Phred score \< 20) were trimmed, and reads shorter than 50 bp were no
longer used to ensure the high-quality and keep the data integrity high
for the downstream analysis. After this first trim, the data was
assessed to see if the data quality had improved again using
`fastplong`. It was concluded that the data did not need more trimming,
allowing the next step to proceed.

#### 2.3.2 Identifying microorganisms using taxonomic classification

The processed FASTQ files were run through the pipeline's next step,
`Kraken2`. `Kraken2` was used to get the taxonomic classification of
each found microorganism. This was done by matching k-mer sequences
(nucleotide sequences), giving `Kraken2` high accuracy. The output file
has a certain structure with some important things like the taxonomy ID,
whether a sequence was classified or not and a list containing the
lowest common ancestor. The identities of the present microorganisms
were revealed by their taxonomy ID, however, reading each ID and
searching these up would be quite inefficient. This will be solved with
the visualisation step, which takes these IDs and visualises them.

#### 2.3.3 Visualisation of kraken2 results

To visualise what has been found from the Taxonomic classification of
the `Kraken2` tool, we used a multitude of different tools, `KronaTools`
was used to create krona plot, a krona plot shows all taxonomic levels
based on the NCBI taxonomy starting from superkingdom to family level
and the associated abundances based on the number of identified spectra
summed over all BGPs (Bacterial Gene Product). This was used in the
paper to show what had been found in an easy to interpret way. `Pavian`
was used to create an interactive browser application that analysed and
visualised metagenomics classification results from classifiers such as
`Kraken2`. `Pavian` also provided an alignment viewer to validate
matches to a particular genome. Specific visualisations that could be
found in the browser application are: a taxonomic classification chart,
a Sankey diagram, and the alignment viewer.

#### 2.3.4 Other visualisations

`HUMAnN 3.0` was used to profile the abundance of microbial metabolic
pathways and other molecular functions from the data. This showed the
metabolic potential of the microbial community that was present in the
lagoon samples. This helped us answer the question of “What are the
microorganisms in the lagoon doing or capable of doing?”. `QIIME2`, a
tool that made a Shannon index for alpha diversity, this index showed
the species diversity in each sample. This index also showed the
distribution of the species in the samples. After it was clear what the
distribution was of these microorganisms, we could build a microbiome
structure for each step in the lagoon. These structures have been used
to answer the questions about the lagoon, “*Not clear yet*”

## Study concept AFAC

**Study Concept: Investigating Microbial Community in an Anaerobic
Reactor for the Treatment of Wastewater from a Molasses-Based Spirit and
Yeast Production Factory**

**1.**     **Introduction**

The production of industrial spirits and yeast from molasses generates a
significant volume of high-strength wastewater rich in organic matter,
nutrients, and recalcitrant compounds. Anaerobic digestion is a
promising biological treatment technology for such wastewater, as it
facilitates organic matter degradation while producing biogas as a
valuable byproduct. However, the efficiency and stability of anaerobic
treatment largely depend on the composition and dynamics of the
microbial community involved in the process. This study aims to
investigate the microbial consortia within an anaerobic reactor treating
wastewater from a molasses-based spirit and yeast production factory to
enhance reactor performance and stability.

**2.**     **Problem Statement**

Despite the widespread application of anaerobic digestion for treating
molasses-based wastewater, challenges such as process instability,
incomplete degradation of organic pollutants, and low methane yield
persist. These challenges are often linked to shifts in microbial
community structure and function within the reactor. Understanding the
microbial diversity, interactions, and metabolic pathways in the system
is crucial for optimizing treatment performance, improving process
resilience, and maximizing energy recovery.

**3.**     **Objectives**

The study will focus on the following objectives:

-   To characterize the microbial community structure in an anaerobic
    reactor treating molasses wastewater.
-   To analyze the functional roles of key microbial species in organic
    matter degradation and methane production.
-   To assess the impact of operational conditions on microbial
    diversity and reactor performance.
-   To explore potential strategies for improving microbial activity and
    process efficiency.

**4.**     **Methodology**

-   **Sample Collection:** Wastewater and sludge samples will be
    collected from different reactor compartments over a defined
    operational period.

-   **Physicochemical Analysis:** Key parameters such as pH, COD, BOD,
    VFA, alkalinity, and methane yield will be monitored.

-   **Microbial Analysis:**

-   DNA extraction from reactor biomass samples.

-   High-throughput sequencing (e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequencing) to
    identify microbial taxa.

-   Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to determine functional
    gene profiles.

-   Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and qPCR for quantitative
    assessment of key microbial groups.

-   **Data Analysis:** Bioinformatics tools will be used to analyze
    sequencing data, determine microbial community diversity indices,
    and establish correlations between microbial populations and reactor
    performance.

**5.**     **Expected Outcomes**

-   Identification of dominant microbial taxa involved in organic matter
    degradation and methanogenesis.
-   Insights into microbial interactions and metabolic pathways critical
    for process stability.
-   Correlation between microbial community shifts and operational
    performance.
-   Recommendations for optimizing anaerobic reactor conditions for
    enhanced treatment efficiency and biogas production.

**6.**     **Significance of the Study**

The findings will contribute to a better understanding of microbial
ecology in anaerobic reactors treating molasses wastewater. The insights
gained will support the development of strategies for process
optimisation, leading to improved wastewater treatment, enhanced biogas
recovery, and reduced environmental impact.

**7.**     **Conclusion**

This study will provide valuable knowledge on the microbial community
dynamics in anaerobic digestion systems treating molasses wastewater.
The outcomes will help improve anaerobic reactor design and operational
strategies, ultimately contributing to sustainable industrial wastewater
management and renewable energy generation.

### What does this mean for us?

We now know the exact problem, this being: “Instability and incomplete
degradation of organic pollutants + low methane yield persist in the
digestor”.

The goal of this project is: “Understanding the microbial diversity,
interactions, and metabolic pathways will help optimise performance,
improve resilience and maximise energy recovery from the digestor”

**14th of march** *Starting my part of the snakemake pipeline*

Finding the right tools was difficult, this was because there wasn’t
allot of documentation regarding QIIME2 in snakemake. There was no
wrapper either so i had to find out all the steps necesarry for the
shannon index for alpha diversity.

using the QIIME2 docs and forums, I found there were a few steps before
the \# Snakemake

Snake make will be used to create a pipeline for our project. This
pipeline must do the following: - Check the quality of the data and if
needed trim it. - Identify the microorganisms that are in the data with
taxonomic classification - Visualise the results of the taxonomic
classification - Show the diversity of what the samples contain

For the qiime2 pipeline our fastq file had to be turned into a qza file,
then it had to be trimmed and denoised (at this step it was found out
that the denoiser had an immense amount of struggle due to out data
being from the minION) after that it needed a feature table, then after
generating all these files a shannon index for alpha diversity could be
created. The visualisation was also

    shell:
        "python beta_diversity.py -i {input} --type bracken > {output}"
```

The reason for using the Python script over the QIIME2 is efficiency due
to it being able to use the bracken files that are generated with the
kraken2 tool. It also makes the pipeline less complex.

The final version needed Bracken files and not Kraken files. **script

```         
Shannon's diversity: 1.5663177218772828
```

How do you interpret the shannon diversity? The Shannon diversity index
will tell us how big the diversity of organisms is per sample, 0 means
there is one organism and any higher means that there are multiple

$$ H=−∑[(pi​)×log(pi​)]$$

where:

-   H - Shannon diversity index;
-   pi - proportion of individuals of i-th species in a whole community;
-   ∑ - sum symbol; and
-   log - usually the natural logarithm, but the base of the logarithm
    is arbitrary (10 and 2 based logarithms are also used).

$$pi=n/N$$

-   n - individuals of a given type/species; and
-   N - total number of individuals in a community, There is no upper
    range for the shannon diversity index.

**QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (50) - 51704** - What is this kit used for:
This is a purification and enrichment kit of bacterial microbiome DNA
from swabs (and body fluids). Effective depletion of host DNA during the
purification process maximises bacterial DNA coverage in NGS analysis
and allows for 16rDNA-based microbiome analysis and whole metagenome
shotgun sequencing studies

**Procedure**

The kit employs spin column technology with a specialized protocol to
enrich bacterial microbiome DNA while minimizing host DNA contamination.
First, host cells are gently lysed, and their released DNA is
enzymatically degraded. Next, bacterial cells are disrupted using
optimized mechanical and chemical lysis. The bacterial DNA is then
selectively bound to a silica membrane, purified through washes, and
finally eluted for analysis.

This method ensures efficient isolation of bacterial DNA from complex
samples, reducing host DNA interference.
